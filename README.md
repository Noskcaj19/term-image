Supports several renderers, including:

* Unicode half blocks, fractional blocks, and drawing characters
* Unicode braille characters
* ASCII text
* Supports iTerm2 and kitty protocols to render images in full resolutions
  
Supports both Truecolor (RGB color) and ANSI Color (256 color).

While primarily a command line tool, all functionality exists as a crate for embedding.
